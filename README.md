DOG BREED Scraper

This is a simple Python script that fetches and prints a list of dog breeds using the public dog.ceo Dog API.
Retrieves all dog breeds and sub-breeds.

- Displays the breeds in a numbered list.

- Uses the free, no-authentication required dog.ceo API.

- Handles errors gracefully (e.g., API failures or JSON parsing issues).

Prerequisites
Python 3.5 installed
requests library installed

Install the requests library via pip if you don't have it:
pip install requests

Notes
The dog.ceo API is free and does not require an API key.

If you want to extend this, consider saving the data to a file or fetching images for each breed.
